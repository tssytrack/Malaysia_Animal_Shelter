# Malaysia_Animal_Shelter

In this project, around 10,000 rows of animal adoption data from animal shelters in San Diego were explored and analyzed with the goal of trying to discover the key drivers that can influence the likelihood of adoption. The deliverables include the following:

1. An interactive dashboard visualizes the interaction between adoption and several explanatory variables such as health condition, breed, etc
2. Predictive models that can identify important features in predicting shelter animals' adoption outcome as well as be used in predicting future cases
